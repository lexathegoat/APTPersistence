## Detection Report Structure

```json 
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-31T10:30:00",
  "technique": "Registry Run Key",
  "severity": "HIGH|MEDIUM|CRITICAL",
  "location": "Path or registry key",
  "details": "Detailed findings",
  "os": "Windows|Linux"
}
```
## Severity Levels
- CRITICAL = Immediate threat requiring urgent response
- HIGH = Suspicious activity with high confidence
- MEDIUM = Potentially suspicious requiring investigation

## EDR Testing

The framework includes pre-configured test scenarios for
validating EDR capabilities. Each scenario contains:

- Test command for creating persistence
- Cleanup command for safe removal
- Expected EDR detection behaivor
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping

**Warning**: Only execute test scenarios in authorized testing environments.
